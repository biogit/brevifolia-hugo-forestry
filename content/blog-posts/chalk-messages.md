## Public Message Board

Urban surfaces are excellent public message boards, as they may be seen by thousands of people in popular locations in a city.

The Twitter-like aspect of writing on the sidewalk is highlighted by the use of hashtags in the modern messages transmitted in chalk.

### Walls

Before Facebook virtual walls, very physical walls were used to publicly post messages and art, both private and public as well as anonymous and signed.

Whether 40000-years-old [cave paintings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting) or [graffiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti) left by ancient cultures should be considered the true predecessors of the modern use of chalk on public walls, this practice has very old roots and writing on the walls is basically as old as writing itself.
