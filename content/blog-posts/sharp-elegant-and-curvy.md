## Sharp Lines and Smooth Curves

Writing on a clean blackboard can produce chalk lines with sharp edges and smooth curves and turns. And these lines, in turn (yep, [pun](../first-post/ "chalky puns") [intended](../physical-and-ephemeral/ "more chalky puns")), attract other lines, that are just as curvy and considerably more elegant.

Or maybe it is not about the chalk at all, but some common artistic quality on both sides of this photograph is difficult to deny.
