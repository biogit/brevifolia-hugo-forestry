## White Cliffs of Dover

Despite being [ephemeral](../physical-and-ephemeral/ "Chalk: Physical and Ephemeral") when used for writing, as a material, chalk actually provides a nearly eternal record--valid over geological time--of various micro-organisms that lived only for a few fleeting moments, well before humans started using chalk for writing.

The [White Cliffs of Dover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Cliffs_of_Dover) are probably the most famous example of the chalky eternity.
