## Blackboards in Schools

[Blackboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard) have been used in schools for centuries and their introduction is recognized to have created a new environment for teaching, learning, and testing.

### Rigid but Flexible

Despite the actual physical surface of most blackboards being _literally_ rigid (made of slate, metal, or hard plastic), they provide an intrinsically (and _figuratively_) flexible medium for education.

Chalk is available at low cost, in different colors and sizes, making it accessible as a teaching tool across the world.
