## The Original Re-writeable Recording Technology

Chalk writing combines _physical_ (as in both _tangible_ and _related to Physics_--the puns continue, as [promised](../first-post "chalky puns")) and ephemeral qualities.

This is a rather cool combination of features in the digital age, when ephemeral usually means virtual, although both chalk and magnetic or electronic storage are ephemeral primarily because they are erasable.

### Ephemera and Water

In another cutesy analogy, just as water is an excellent way to erase any chalk writing, it can also erase some forms of digital storage, as anyone who anxiously waited for the washing cycle to finish--after forgetting a memory card in a pocket--can attest.
