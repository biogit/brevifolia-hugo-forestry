## Pure Public Art?

The artists who invest many hours to create an elaborate chalk drawing on a sidewalk are arguably engaged in one of the most public forms of art display, whereby both the process and the product are completely open to the public.

A smiley face drawn in chalk on a sidewalk will last a bit longer than its _Snapchat_ analog, but both share the in-the-moment emotional message.
