## Home Sweet Home

Not really, actually tastes kind of chalky.

### Colors of the Rainbow

Well, there are seven colors in the [full version](https://unsplash.com/photos/1v1zjqxldmc "chalk houses") of the hero image, but not quite the traditional "rainbow" ones, nor are they in the correct [order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROYGBIV "colors of the rainbow").

### Homepage Icons?

Sure, why not! Like the color options for icons in software for making prototypes or wireframes of web pages. Even the color pickers are there, next to the corresponding icons.

Too bad that clicking is disabled and refresh rates are rather low.
